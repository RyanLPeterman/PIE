   + Found guard in B4 for loop #1

     - post_1 : (true & (x = (n * n)))
     - guard : (r != 0)

   [Q1] Abduction query = ((r != 0) | (true & (x = (n * n))))
   [#] Simplified query: ((r != 0) | (true & (x = (n * n))))

     - Result = (x = (n * n))

   # Loop_1 | Invariant @ Postcondition: (x = (n * n))

   # Loop_1 | Inductive Check: ((!(x = (n * n))) | (!(r != 0)) | ((x + ((2 * (n + 1)) - 1)) = ((n + 1) * (n + 1)))) is valid!

   # Precondition Check: (0 = (0 * 0)) is valid!
