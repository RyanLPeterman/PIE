[#] Starting Loop Invariant Generation ...

   + Found guard in B7 for loop #1

     - post_1 : (((true & (x = (2 * y))) | (!((i % 2) = 0))) & (true | ((i % 2) = 0)))
     - guard : (i < n)

   [Q1] Abduction query = ((i < n) | (((true & (x = (2 * y))) | (!((i % 2) = 0))) & (true | ((i % 2) = 0))))
   [#] Simplified query: ((i < n) | (((true & (x = (2 * y))) | (!((i % 2) = 0))) & (true | ((i % 2) = 0))))
