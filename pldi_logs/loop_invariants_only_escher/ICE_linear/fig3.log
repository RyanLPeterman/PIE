   + Found guard in B5 for loop #1

     - post_1 : (true & (lock = 1))
     - guard : (x != y)

   [Q1] Abduction query = ((x != y) | (true & (lock = 1)))
   [#] Simplified query: ((x != y) | (true & (lock = 1)))

   # Loop_1 | Invariant @ Postcondition: (lock = ((x - y) + 1))

   # Loop_1 | Inductive Check: ((!(lock = ((x - y) + 1))) | (!(x != y)) | (((0 = ((y - (y + 1)) + 1)) | false) & ((1 = ((y - y) + 1)) | false))) is valid!

   # Precondition Check: (((0 = ((y - (y + 1)) + 1)) | false) & ((1 = ((y - y) + 1)) | false)) is valid!
