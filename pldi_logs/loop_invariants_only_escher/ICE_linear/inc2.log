[#] Starting Loop Invariant Generation ...

   + Found guard in B4 for loop #1

     - post_1 : (true & (x = N))
     - guard : (x < N)

   [Q1] Abduction query = ((x < N) | (true & (x = N)))
   [#] Simplified query: ((x < N) | (true & (x = N)))

    [*] Synthesizing --- 
    [?] Verifying --- true                            
      [+] Added test ... [ 0, -1 ]

    [*] Synthesizing ---  @2 @3
    [?] Verifying --- (x <= N)                            

     - Result = (x <= N)

   # Loop_1 | Invariant @ Postcondition: (x <= N)

   # Loop_1 | Inductive Check: ((!(x <= N)) | (!(x < N)) | ((x + 1) <= N)) is valid!

   # Precondition Check: ((!(N >= 0)) | (0 <= N)) is valid!


[###] Final invariants: [###]
